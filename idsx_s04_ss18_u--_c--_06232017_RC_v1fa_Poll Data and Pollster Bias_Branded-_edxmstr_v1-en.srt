RAFAEL IRIZARRY: In this video we use public polling data

1
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,870
organized by FiveThirtyEight for the 2016 presidential election.

2
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,590
The data is included as part of the dslabs package.

3
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,040
You can get the data by typing this code.

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,000
Here, we show you the column names of the table.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,880
The table includes results for national polls,

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,260
as well as state polls, taken in the year before the election.

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,840
For this first illustrative example, we will

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,650
filter the data to include national polls that happened during the week

9
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,270
before the election.

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,730
We also remove polls that FiveThirtyEight

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,250
has determined not to be reliable, and they have graded them with a B or less.

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,260
Some polls have not been graded.

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,540
And we&#39;re going to leave these in.

14
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,520
Here&#39;s the code we used to filter as we just described.

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,560
We also add a spread estimate.

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,950
Remember, the spread is what we&#39;re really interested in estimating.

17
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,440
So, we type this code to get the spread in proportions.

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,220
For illustrative purpose, we will assume that there are only two parties,

19
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,100
and call p the proportion voting for Clinton,

20
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,560
and 1 minus p the proportion voting for Trump.

21
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,240
We&#39;re interested in the spread, which we&#39;ve shown is 2p minus 1.

22
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,320
Let&#39;s call this spread d. d is for difference.

23
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,990
Note that we have several estimates of this spread coming

24
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,600
from the different polls.

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,360
The theory we learned tells us that these estimates

26
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,300
are a random variable with probability distribution

27
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,340
that is approximately normal.

28
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,760
The expected value is the election night spread, d.

29
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,880
And the standard error is 2 times the square root of p times

30
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,340
1 minus p divided by the sample size N. Assuming the urn model we described

31
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,670
earlier are useful models, we can use this information

32
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,190
to construct a confidence interval based on the aggregated data.

33
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:04,170
The estimated spread is now computed like this because now the sample size

34
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,530
is the sum of all the sample sizes.

35
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,070
And if we use this, we get a standard error,

36
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:17,820
typing this code, that then leads us to a margin of error of .0066,

37
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,440
a very small margin of error.

38
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,650
So, if we were going to use this data, we would report a spread of 1.43%

39
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,640
with a margin of error of 0.66%.

40
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,310
On election night, we find out that the actual percentage

41
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,260
is 2.1%, which is outside of the 95% confidence interval.

42
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,010
So, what happened?

43
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,500
Was this just bad luck?

44
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,980
A histogram of the reported spreads shows another problem.

45
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,030
With this code, we can quickly make a histogram of the spreads

46
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,390
that we&#39;re looking at.

47
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,730
The data does not appear to be normally distributed,

48
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,770
and the standard error appears to be larger than 0.0066.

49
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,870
The theory is not quite working here.

50
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,410
To see why, notice that various pollsters are involved

51
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,630
and some are taking several polls a week.

52
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,540
Here&#39;s a table showing you how many polls each pollster

53
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,630
took that last week.

54
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,830
Let&#39;s visualize the data for the pollsters that are regularly polling.

55
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,220
We write this piece of code that first filters for only pollsters that

56
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,350
polled more than 6 times.

57
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,310
And then we simply plot the spreads estimated by each pollster.

58
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,680
Each one has between five and six.

59
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,250
This plot reveals an unexpected result. First

60
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,300
note that the standard error, predicted by theory for each poll--

61
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,340
now, we&#39;re going to do this poll by poll--

62
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:45,450
gives us values between 0.018 and 0.033.

63
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,130
This appears to be right.

64
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,910
This appears to be consistent with what we see in the plot.

65
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,350
However, there appears to be differences across the polls.

66
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,040
This is not explained by the theory.

67
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,290
Note for example, how the USC Dornsife/LA Times

68
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,320
pollster is predicting a 4% win for Trump

69
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,640
while Ipsos is predicting a win larger than 5% for Clinton.

70
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,210
The theory of learned says nothing about different pollsters producing polls

71
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,360
with different expected values.

72
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,440
All the polls should have the same expected value,

73
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,540
the actual spread, the spread we will see on election night.

74
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,440
FiveThirtyEight refers to these differences as &quot;house effects.&quot;

75
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,440
We can also call them pollster bias.

76
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,260
Rather than use urn model theory, we&#39;re instead

77
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,550
going to develop a data-driven model to produce a better estimate and a better

78
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,610
confidence interval.
