RAFAEL IRIZARRY: When using the theory we just described,

1
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,260
it is important to remember that it is the intervals that

2
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,870
are at random, not p.

3
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,200
We showed a plot where we could see the random intervals that

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,680
were moving around.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,610
And we also saw p. p was not moving around.

6
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,730
It was fixed, and it was represented with a vertical line.

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,170
It was staying in the same place.

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:33,730
So the 95% relates to the probability that the random interval falls on top of p.

9
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:39,010
Saying that p has a 95% chance of being between this and that

10
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:45,300
is technically an incorrect statement-- again, because p is not random.
