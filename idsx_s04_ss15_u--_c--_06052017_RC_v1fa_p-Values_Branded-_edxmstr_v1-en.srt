RAFAEL IRIZARRY: p-values are very common in,

1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,510
for example, the scientific literature.

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,550
They are related to confidence intervals,

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,030
so we introduce the concept here.

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,810
Let&#39;s consider the blue and red bead example again.

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,970
Suppose that rather than wanting to estimate

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,080
the spread or the proportion of blue, I&#39;m interested only in the question,

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,780
are there more blue beads than red beads?

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,800
Another way to ask that is, is 2p minus 1 bigger than 0?

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,990
Is the spread bigger than 0?

10
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:39,480
So suppose we take a random sample of, say, 100 beads,

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,360
and we observe 52 blue beads.

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,290
This gives us a spread of 4%.

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,430
This seems to be pointing to there being more blue beads than red beads,

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,220
because 4% is larger than 0.

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,130
52% is larger than 48%.

16
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,760
However, as data scientists, we need to be skeptical.

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,930
We know there is chance involved in this process,

18
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,875
and we can get a 52 even when the actual spread is 0.

19
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:11,250
The null hypothesis is the skeptic&#39;s hypothesis.

20
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,480
In this case, it would be the spread is 0.

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:21,300
We have observed a random variable 2 times X-bar minus 1, which in this case

22
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:27,240
is 4%, and the p-value is the answer to the question, how

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,790
likely is it to see a value this large when the null hypothesis is true?

24
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:41,010
So we write, what&#39;s the probability of X-bar minus 0.5 being bigger than 2%?

25
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,038
That&#39;s the same as asking, what&#39;s the chance that the spread is 4 or more?

26
00:01:46,038 --> 00:01:51,530
The null hypothesis is that the spread is 0 or that p is a half.

27
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:56,550
Under the null hypothesis, we know that this quantity here, the square root

28
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:02,130
of n times X-bar minus 0.5 divided by the square root of 0.5 times 1

29
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,920
minus 0.5, is a standard normal.

30
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,910
We&#39;ve taken a random variable and divided it by its standard error

31
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,520
after subtracting its expected value.

32
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,320
So we can compute the probability, which is a p-value,

33
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,920
using this equation, which reduces to this equation, where

34
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,590
z is a standard normal.

35
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,710
And now we can use code to compute this.

36
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,530
We compute the probability, which is equal to 69% in this case.

37
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,360
This is the p-value.

38
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,870
In this case, there&#39;s actually a large chance of seeing 52 blue beads or more

39
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,900
under the null hypothesis that there is the same amount

40
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,210
of blue beads as red beads.

41
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:49,740
So the 52 blue beads are not very strong evidence,

42
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,520
are not very convincing, if we want to make the case that there&#39;s

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,540
more blue beads than red beads.

44
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,880
Note that there&#39;s a close connection between p-values and confidence

45
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,630
intervals.

46
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:06,390
If a 95% confidence interval of the spread does not include 0,

47
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:11,910
we can do a little bit of math to see that this implies that the p-value must

48
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:19,230
be smaller than 1 minus 95%, or 0.05.

49
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,530
To learn more about p-values, you can consult any statistics textbook.

50
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,480
However, in general, we prefer reporting confidence intervals

51
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,470
over p-values, since it gives us an idea of the size of the estimate.

52
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,810
The p-value simply reports a probability and says nothing

53
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,570
about the significance of the finding in the context of the problem.
