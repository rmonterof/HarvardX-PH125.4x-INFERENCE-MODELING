RAFAEL IRIZARRY: We can run a Monte Carlo

1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:14,120
simulation to confirm that, in fact, a 95% confidence interval includes p 95%

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,650
of the time.

3
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,709
We write the simulation like this.

4
00:00:17,709 --> 00:00:20,000
We&#39;re going to write the simulation we&#39;ve been writing.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,850
But now, we&#39;re going to actually construct the confidence

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,850
interval inside the call to replicate.

7
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:32,310
And in the very final line, we&#39;re going to ask, is p included in the interval.

8
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,310
We&#39;re going to return either true or false.

9
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,820
To compute how often it happened, we compute the mean

10
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,790
of that vector of true and false.

11
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,680
We run a simulation and we get 0.9522.

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,050
This plot shows you the first few confidence

13
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,800
intervals that were generated in our Monte Carlo simulation.

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,670
In this case, we created simulations so we know what p is.

15
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:00,030
In the plot, it&#39;s represented with a vertical black line.

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,570
Notice that you can see the confidence intervals varying.

17
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,489
Each time, they fall in slightly different places.

18
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,250
This is because they&#39;re random variables.

19
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,210
We also know that most of the times, p is

20
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:15,950
included inside the confidence interval. p is not moving, of course, because p

21
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,970
is not a random variable.

22
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,100
We also see that, every once in a while, we actually miss p.

23
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,340
These confidence intervals are shown in red.

24
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,240
We should only see about 5% of the intervals

25
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,530
in red because they&#39;re 95% confidence intervals.

26
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,100
This plot should help you understand what confidence intervals are

27
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,130
and what they mean.
