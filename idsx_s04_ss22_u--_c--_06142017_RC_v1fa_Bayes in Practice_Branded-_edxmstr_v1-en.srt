RAFAEL IRIZARRY: To demonstrate the usefulness

1
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,840
of hierarchical models, Bayesian models, in practice,

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,870
we&#39;re going to show you a baseball example.

3
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:20,380
In sports, we use Bayesian thinking all the time, even if we don&#39;t realize it.

4
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,390
Let&#39;s go to the example.

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,360
Jose Iglesias is a professional baseball player.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,810
In April 2013, when he was starting his career, he was performing rather well.

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,430
He had been to bat 20 times and he had nine hits,

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,290
which is an average of 0.450.

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:44,800
This average of 0.450 means Jose had been successful 45% of the times he had

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,740
batted, which is rather high historically speaking.

11
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,600
Note, for example, that no one has finished a season with an average

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,510
of 0.400 or more since Ted Williams did it in 1941.

13
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,950
To illustrate the way hierarchical models are powerful,

14
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:06,160
we will try to predict Jose&#39;s batting average at the end of the season.

15
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,050
In a typical season, players have about 500 or bats.

16
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,030
With the techniques we have learned up to now,

17
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,440
referred to as frequentist statistics, the best we can do

18
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,320
is provide a confidence interval.

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,310
We can think of outcomes for hitting as a binomial with a success rate of p.

20
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:32,560
So if the success rate is indeed 0.450, the standard error of just 20 at bats

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,910
can be computed like this.

22
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,010
And it&#39;s 0.111.

23
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,520
We can use this to construct a 95% confidence interval, which

24
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,850
will be from 0.228 to 0.672.

25
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,560
This prediction has two problems.

26
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,150
First, it&#39;s very large, so it&#39;s not very useful.

27
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:57,640
Second, it&#39;s centered at 0.450, which implies that our best guess is that

28
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,680
this relatively unknown player will break Ted Williams&#39; longstanding

29
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,600
record.

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,680
If you follow baseball, this last statement will seem wrong.

31
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,290
And this is because you&#39;re implicitly using

32
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,380
the hierarchical model that factors in information

33
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,350
from years of following baseball.

34
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:22,150
Here we show how we can quantify this intuition.

35
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,840
First, let&#39;s explore the distribution of batting averages

36
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,410
for all players with more than 500 at bats

37
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:34,690
during the seasons 2010, 2011, and 2012.

38
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,480
Here are the histograms.

39
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,064
We note that the average player had an average of 0.275.

40
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:46,150
And the standard deviation of the population of all these players

41
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,300
was 0.027.

42
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,070
So we can see already that 0.450 would be quite an anomaly,

43
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:58,640
since it is over six standard deviations away from the average.

44
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,480
So is Jose lucky or the best batter seen in the last 50 years?

45
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,670
Perhaps it&#39;s a combination of both.

46
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:11,980
But how do we decide how much of this is luck and how much of this is talent?

47
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,190
If we become convinced that this is just luck,

48
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:20,830
we should trade him to a team that trusts the 0.450 observation and is

49
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,840
maybe overestimating his potential.
