RAFAEL IRIZARRY: What does it mean when an election forecaster tells us

1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,840
that a given candidate has a 90% chance of winning?

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,360
In the context of the urn model this would

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,980
be equivalent to stating that the probability that the proportion p

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,170
of people voting for this candidate being bigger than 0.5, than 50%,

5
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,990
is 90%.

6
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,520
But as we discussed, in the urn model, p is a fixed parameter,

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,700
and it does not make sense to talk about the probability of p

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,690
being this or that.

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,710
With Bayesian statistics, we assume it is in fact random.

10
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,470
And then it makes sense to talk about probability.

11
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,310
Forecasters also use models to describe variability at different levels.

12
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:52,050
For example: sampling variability, pollster to pollster variability,

13
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,130
day to day variability, and election to election variability.

14
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,680
One of the most successful approaches used

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,590
to describe these different levels of variability

16
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,170
are called hierarchical models.

17
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,200
And hierarchical models are best explained

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,140
in the context of Bayesian statistics.

19
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,230
Bayesian statistics is the topic of the following videos.
