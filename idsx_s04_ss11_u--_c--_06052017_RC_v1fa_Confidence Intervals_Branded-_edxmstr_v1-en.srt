RAFAEL IRIZARRY: We are ready to learn about confidence intervals.

1
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,410
Confidence intervals are a very useful concept that

2
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,290
are widely used by data scientists.

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,830
A version of these that are very commonly seen come from the ggplot

4
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,590
geometry geom_smooth().

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,130
Here&#39;s an example using some weather data.

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,510
We write the code like this and we get a picture that looks like this.

7
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,439
We will later learn how this curve is formed, but note

8
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,200
the shaded area around the curve.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,760
This shaded area is created using the concept of confidence intervals.

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,730
In our competition, we were asked to give an interval.

11
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,570
If the interval you submit includes the actual proportion p,

12
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,580
you get half the money you spent on your poll

13
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,450
back and pass to the next stage of the competition.

14
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,360
One way to pass to the second round of the competition

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,850
to report a very large interval-- for example, the interval 0 to 1.

16
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,308
This is guaranteed to include p.

17
00:01:03,308 --> 00:01:06,310
However, with an interval this big, we have

18
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,920
no chance of winning the competition.

19
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,560
Similarly, if you are an election forecaster

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,770
and predict the spread will be between negative 100 and 100,

21
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,560
you&#39;ll be ridiculed for stating the obvious.

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,260
Even a smaller interval such as saying that the spread will

23
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,180
be between minus 10% and 10% will not be considered serious.

24
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,980
On the other hand, the smaller the interval

25
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,810
we report, the smaller our chance of passing to the second round.

26
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,980
Similarly, a bold pollster that reports very small intervals

27
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:41,230
and misses the mark most of the time will not be considered a good pollster.

28
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,720
We want to be somewhere in between.

29
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,660
Confidence intervals will help us get there.

30
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,380
We can use the statistical theory we have learned to compute,

31
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,790
for any given interval, the probability that it includes p.

32
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,150
Similarly if we are asked to create an interval with, say,

33
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:03,290
a 95% chance of including p, we can do that as well.

34
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,570
These are called 95% confidence intervals.

35
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:11,440
Note that when pollsters report an estimate and a margin of error,

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,750
they are, in a way, reporting a 95% confidence interval.

37
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,880
Let&#39;s show how this works mathematically.

38
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,750
We want to know the probability that the interval X-bar minus 2 times

39
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:28,120
the estimated standard error to X-bar plus 2 times

40
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,820
its estimated standard error contains the actual proportion p.

41
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:39,490
First, note that the start and end of this interval are random variables.

42
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,720
Every time that we take a sample, they change.

43
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,410
To illustrate this, we&#39;re going to run a Monte Carlo simulation.

44
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,356
We&#39;re going to do it just twice first.

45
00:02:49,356 --> 00:02:50,980
So we&#39;re going to use these parameters.

46
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,780
We&#39;re going to make p 0.45 and N 1,000.

47
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,470
Note that the interval we get when we write this code

48
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,300
is different from what we get if we run that same code again.

49
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,820
If we keep sampling and creating intervals,

50
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,780
we will see that this is due to random variation.

51
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,350
To determine the probability that the interval includes p,

52
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,230
we need to compute this probability.

53
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,690
By subtracting and dividing the same quantities

54
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,260
in all parts of the equation, we get that the equation

55
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,200
is equivalent to this.

56
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,100
The term in the middle is an approximately normal random variable

57
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,330
with expected value 0 and standard error 1, which

58
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,660
we have been denoting with capital Z.

59
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,180
So what we have is, what is the probability

60
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,860
of a standard normal variable being between minus 2 and 2?

61
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,560
And this is, we know, about 95%.

62
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,860
So we have a 95% confidence interval.

63
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,110
Note that if we want to have a larger probability, say 99%,

64
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,850
a 99% confidence interval, we need to multiply by whatever

65
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,730
z satisfies the following equation.

66
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,540
Note that by using the quantity that we get by typing this code,

67
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:16,240
which is about 2.576, will do it, because by definition the pnorm of what

68
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:23,420
we get when we type qnorm(0.995) is by definition 0.995.

69
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:32,020
And by symmetry, pnorm of 1 minus qnorm(0.995) is 1 minus 0.995.

70
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,540
So now we compute pnorm minus pnorm minus z, we get 99%.

71
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,770
This is what we wanted.

72
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,880
We can use this approach for any percentile q.

73
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,455
We use 1 minus (1 minus q) divided by 2.

74
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:51,850
Why this number-- because of what we just saw, 1 minus (1 minus q)

75
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,520
divided by 2 plus (1 minus q) divided by 2 equals q.

76
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,360
And we get what we want.

77
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,950
Also note that to get exactly 0.95, we actually

78
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,510
use a slightly smaller number than 2.

79
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,500
How do we know?

80
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,150
We type qnorm of 0.975 and we see that the value

81
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:17,080
that we should be using to get exactly a 95% confidence interval is 1.96.
